Front-End Technologies (Client-Side) 
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): This is the foundation of every webpage, providing the basic structure and content.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to control the appearance, layout, and styling of HTML elements, making web pages visually appealing.
JavaScript: This programming language adds dynamic content and interactivity to web pages, allowing for user actions and complex features.
Key Concepts
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): A protocol defining rules for how browsers and servers exchange information on the internet. 
Client-Server Model: When you visit a website, your browser (the client) sends a request to a server, which sends back the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to display the page. 
Responsive Design: The practice of creating web pages that adapt and look good on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones. 
Version Control (e.g., Git): A system for tracking and managing changes to your code, essential for collaboration and maintaining project history. 
The Web Development Process
The development of a website typically follows a structured process, which can include: 
Analysis: Understanding the project's goals and requirements.
Planning: Outlining the website's structure and content.
Design: Creating the user interface and user experience.
Development: Writing the code to build the website.
Testing: Ensuring the website functions correctly and is free of bugs.
Deployment: Launching the website to make it accessible to users.
Maintenance: Ongoing updates and improvements after launch.
